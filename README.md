# VERCEL(DEPLOY-YOUR-WEBSITE) 

A scalable, modern deployment platform inspired by Vercel, designed to simplify the deployment and management of applications. This project leverages a powerful stack of technologies including Node.js, Docker, AWS ECS/ECR, Kafka, and ClickHouse to provide seamless, efficient, and reliable application hosting.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js: Core backend for handling APIs and business logic.
               Express.js: Framework for building REST APIs.
- **ORM**: Prisma.
- **Containerization**: Docker: Used to containerize applications for consistent deployment.
                         Docker Compose: Manages multi-container setups for local development.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS ECS/ECR: Elastic Container Service for orchestrating Docker containers, and Elastic Container Registry for storing Docker images.
                          
-**Data Pipeline** :
  Kafka: Message broker for processing and managing real-time deployment logs.
  ClickHouse: Fast and efficient analytics database for querying deployment metrics.

-**Database**
PostgreSQL: Database for storing deployment metadata.
Redis: Caching layer for improved performance.
AWS S3: Storage for static assets and deployment logs.

- **Type Safety**: ZOD, react-hook-form
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Authentication**: JWT

### Setup Guide

This Project contains following services and folders:

- `api-server`: HTTP API Server for REST API's
- `build-server`: Docker Image code which clones, builds and pushes the build to S3
- `s3-reverse-proxy`: Reverse Proxy the subdomains and domains to s3 bucket static assets

### Local Setup

1. Run `npm install` in all the 3 services i.e. `api-server`, `build-server` and `s3-reverse-proxy`
2. Docker build the `build-server` and push the image to AWS ECR.
3. Setup the `api-server` by providing all the required config such as TASK ARN and CLUSTER arn.
4. Run `node index.js` in `api-server` and `s3-reverse-proxy`

At this point following services would be up and running:

| S.No | Service            | PORT    |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------- |
| 1    | `api-server`       | `:9000` |
| 2    | `socket.io-server` | `:9002` |
| 3    | `s3-reverse-proxy` | `:8000` |
